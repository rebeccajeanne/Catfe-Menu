<p style="font-size:large;">&emsp;Cassidy is a superb kitty with an amazing long angora fur coat. She walks like a queen and behaves like one, but that was not quite the Cassidy we rescued. She was thrown out by the family who took her as a kitten because they had gotten tired of having her around. Some people throw out furniture, some throw out clothing, and some simply throw away pets. Her white coat soon became a liability, in no time at all it became matted and dirty. She was living behind a noisy restaurant with not much room to hide. And then the rains came. It rained hard for a few days and nights in a row. We met her on a windy day. She was soaked through, with a skinny tail and matted, dirty, fur. She was limping and crying. We took her because her chances of surviving were slim.</p>
<p style="font-size:large;">&emsp;But what a jewel of a kitty she turned out to be! After a good bath and a trim, she looked very different. The limp disappeared and she started eating. The day we found her playing it was clear that she is perfectly fine, ready to enjoy life and to look for her forever family. Cassifdy has lots of fun! She entertains herself &mdash; loves spinning balls, chasing after little toy mice, and running around the room. But after she uses up a good portion of her energy, she loves to watch all the other cats from her favorite place by the window.</p>
<p style="font-size:large;">&emsp;Cassidy is extremely affectionate and eagerly waits for everyone in the morning. She is a cuddler, but on her own terms. If she decides that it is time to grace your lap with her presence &mdash; she will do just that. But if she decides that she wants to sit next to you, that's where she will sit. Cassidy does not take orders from anyone. She is sweet, playful, and independent. We think that you have just discovered the perfect kitty! Please consider adopting Cassidy. She just wants unconditional love and protection. But she will give back so much!</p>
