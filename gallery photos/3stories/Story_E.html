<p style="font-size:large;">&emsp;Gabriel used to have a home but his family decided that they are done having a cat, opened the door and threw him out. They were living in a rough neighborhood to start with, and Grabriel knew nothing about living outside. His speed and superb tree climbing skills saved him a few times from vicious dogs. But he wasn't as lucky when it came to cats. Gabriel is not a fighter but he had no choice. He got himself into quite a few tough spots and had to fight with a few alley cats. Fur was flying left and right, but he survived. He had seen much worse &mdash; cats with a missing eye, or hopping on 3 legs. But he understood fast that he does not have a chance on the street.</p>
<p style="font-size:large;">&emsp;He was sitting in the corner of the street one day and was watching people passing by. This total stranger approached and caressed his head. Just like that. And said "You poor, poor boy." Gabriel was not looking too great &mdash; with a wound on his leg and a few patches of missing fur. Yet the stranger saw something beyond all this. Gabriel decided that he trusts him and will follow him. He had no place to go in any case. The stranger took him home but could not keep him. He called us and told us Gabriels story; how can you not help a kitty who needs a second chance?</p>
<p style="font-size:large;">&emsp;Gabriel is exceptionally sweet and kind. He is a lovebug, a purring teady bear. Gabriel is affectionate beyond words but is also a bit shy and needs time to start to love and trust. He loves to play but will let other cats ahead. He loves to eat but will let other cats take his food. Gabriel is a pacifist and a friend to all. But most of all, he loves people. Sometimes you leave him sleeping a few feet away, but when you turn around, he is sleeping right by your legs.</p>
<p style="font-size:large;">&emsp;Gabriel is FIV+ (Feline Immunodeficiency Virus positive). We now understand much more about this disease, and the fact that it is not transmitted between cats during normal cohabitation, but only through deep bite wounds. FIV is not transmitted via sharing a litter box, or food or water bowls. More and more homes have both FIV- and FIV+ cats living together for long healthy lives. No treatment is necessary for FIV+ cats. With the proper care (good quality food, and a lot of love) they will live healthy lives, just like any other cat.</p>
<p style="font-size:large;">&emsp;Please help Gabriel find the forever home he has always deserved. You will never hear a bigger purr-er, you will never find a gentler soul. All he wants is love and safety, and will give back love a thousand fold!</p>
