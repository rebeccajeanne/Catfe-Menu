<p style="font-size:large;">&emsp;Benny is not only stunning (you can see that just by looking at him), but he also simply loves cats! Like no one else we've ever met. Any cat. As many cats that can be around him! The more the merrier! He loooooves cats&mdash; pure and simple. His "owner" tossed him out on the street, just like how you throw out a piece of cloth you don't need any longer. You would expect a cat who was thrown out snd had to fight for food for so many months to be more assertive. And not trust people... Well, Benny proves you wrong.</p>
<p style="font-size:large;">&emsp;He is sweeter than honey. Actually, what we first noticed when we met this stunning 2 year old black and white boy while feeding the cat colony he was..."discarded" in, was how hard he was trying to make friends with another cat. Fokd was of much less interest to him than a new feline companion.</p>
<p style="font-size:large;">&emsp;Benny must have had a home before he was abandoned, like so many cats that we rescue. Yet he loves people just as much as he loves cats. And despite the harsh start in life, he has kept his optimism. Benny is always ready to play, purr, run, or simply sit next to you. He is indeed exceptional in every way. Benny can be playful, or serious. He can run like there's no tomorrow, or purr near you. Yes, Benny is a king! But no matter what his mood is, he will always look straight in your eyes and ask, "are you OK?" If you are looking for an equal, for someone to share your life with every single day, for someone to hold and to love, but also for someone to rely on&mdash; Benny is your guy!</p>
<p style="font-size:large;">&emsp;Benny is the protector. He is sweet but he always makes sure that everyone around him is happy. Benny couldn't believe his luck when he came to the Catfe. "Wow, 12&mdash;or is it 13?&mdash;kitties I will be with? My lucky day!" And indeed, it was. Although we hope that much better days are yet to come for him.</p>
<p style="font-size:large;">&emsp;Benny was happy from the second he set foot, sorry&mdash;paw, at the Catfe. He met Marco the day he arrived and it was love at first sight for both of them. Benny and Marco are inseparable. They eat, play, and sleep next to each other every night. They are the only kitties who have formed such a strong bond without growing up together. It was their choice to be together and we will respect their wish. The two of them will bring double the joy to a very lucky family. Will you be the ones to give them a forever home? You have never met a more amazing couple!</p>
<p style="font-size:large;">&emsp;There are many photos of them together; they both love a high quality cardboard box and take turns sitting in it. There is never competition between them, just equitable sharing. And love.</p>
<p style="font-size:large;">&emsp;Benny is absolutely amazing! Would you open your heart to him and his best friend in the world, Marco? You have no idea what a unique, full of love and happiness universe that these boys will open up for you!</p>
