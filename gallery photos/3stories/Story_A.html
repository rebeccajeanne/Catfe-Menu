<p style="font-size:large;">A nice lady found Binx in the street when he was a 4 month old kitten. He was following her everywhere. He would be at her front door first thing in the morning, and last thing in the evening. But she had other cats inside and could not take him, so she called us.</p>

<p style="font-size:large;">We had decided that we will rescue him, but he needed a vet appointment. Yet every day there was another call for help, another injured cat, another desperate situation. Finally, we scheduled his vet appointment for Monday, March 3rd. Sunday, mid-day the nice lady went out to find him and take him inside for one night, to make sure he did not eat before his surgery. But she couldn’t find him!</p>

<p style="font-size:large;">”Binx! Binx?!” — she called many times, but there was no answer. She started looking under bushes, calling and calling. Finally, she heard a faint meow. Binx was under a bush, covered in blood, breathing heavily; he had been hit by a car. She picked him up and took him inside. It was a hard night, but he made it. The doctor saw him the next day and the X-ray showed that he had a broken leg. Binx was scheduled to have his leg amputated on March 12. Both the nice lady and we cried and cried. Binx simply did not know.</p>

<p style="font-size:large;">Maybe there is indeed karma. Or a law of compensation. 10 days later the X-ray showed that the leg was getting better! The nice lady kept him in a crate to limit activity. He would need pain medication and a long road to recovery in a nice, loving home. We knew exactly the foster who would save Binx.</p>

<p style="font-size:large;">Tina is sweet, loving, and compassionate. She didn’t even flinch when she heard Binx’s sad story. She took him the next day and spent day after day with him, giving him pain medication, feeding him, loving him, and playing with him at first a little bit, then more and more. Binx grew stronger and stronger, and the limp started disappearing little by little. His jumps started becoming more confident and higher. In 6 short weeks, Binx was healthy again. This whole adventure had cost Binx one life, but who cares when you’re left with 8 more! And that’s when the next chapter of his life started being written.</p>

<p style="font-size:large;">Binx is a super sweet, jet black kitty with stunning yellow eyes. If you have your back turned and feel that someone is looking at you— it is Binx! He speaks without words. His eyes tell endless stories. Binx is sweet and quiet and extremely loving once he gets to know and trust you. He will be your adorable shadow and follow you wherever you go!</p>

<p style="font-size:large;">All Binx wants is a loving home where he will never have to fear cars, where he can sleep in a warm, cozy bed, and be by your side day after day and night after night. He is calm and sweet and will bring peace and happiness to a very lucky family.</p>

<p style="font-size:large;">Please help Binx find the happiness he so deserves. Please open your heart and home to this gentle, sweet, amazing, and unique boy!</p>
