<p style="font-size:large;">&emsp;Calypso comes from one of the worst cat colonies from a nearby town. You may ask what does 'worst' mean? A place where there is not nearly enough food for all of the cats, where only the fittest or meanest, or sometimes the shyest (barely) survive. She must have been there for a few months becuase when we met her, she was thin as a rail. Half of her hair was missing; she was infested with fleas who were draining her small body of the little energy left in it. She had a slight limp and looked like her days were numbered.</p>
<p style="font-size:large;">&emsp;It was easy to catch her. She could not run. But to everyone's surprise, she closed her eyes, put her head down, and started purring. We knew that no matter how bad she looked, we had to save her. It took some time to mend Calypso, but no one would guess how bad her condition was, looking at her today.</p>
<p style="font-size:large;">&emsp;This calico long haired princess can easily steal your heart. Calypso walks with unmatched grace, gently swinging her tail which is always, unmistakably, up. She walks and behaves like she has all the time in the world. She loves attention and will reward your love with a loud purr. Calypso would definitely prefer a quiet house, where she is safe and loved. She did not forget her harsh past, and will trust you only once she knows you. Where she comes from trust could cost your life. You will have to work hard to earn her love and trust, but what a unique world will open up to the one she chooses.</p>
