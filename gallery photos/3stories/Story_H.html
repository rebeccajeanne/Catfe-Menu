<p style="font-size:large;">Billy and Trout were with Homeless Tails since they were 5 days old. Born on the street to a mom who was one of the skinniest kitties they have ever met, their life did not look too promising. But big doses of daily love and tender care helped these two become the amazingly sweet kitties they are today! These two brothers have turned into incredible lap cats. They play together and purr nonstop. When they get tired, they fall asleep in your lap; always together.</p>
<p style="font-size:large;">They are the funniest kitties you will ever meet. These two amazingly sweet boys are looking for a loving home together, as they do not belong outside! Please consider adopting them, and they will surely fill your home with happiness, laughter, and joy. What brings more happiness than one kitty? Two, of course!</p>
