<p style="font-size:large;">&emsp;Boots was always of the mindset that being super sweet helps. He had lived on the streets all his life and never got into trouble. If cats would fight, he'd stay away. If dogs would bark, he would disappear into the nearest bush. He lived from day to day and never complained about being too hungry. Eating every other day wasn't the end of the world for him. Boots saw the world in rosy colors &mdash; it is his nature.</p>
<p style="font-size:large;">&emsp;And then, this past winter he got really lucky. It was one of those windy days with freezing rain that makes you feel miserable. Boots found shelter near a house and was crouched by the wall. It was true, he was miserable and shivering quite badly. Night was coming and he had absolutely no plan for what to do next. Then, out of the blue, 'Miraculously!' as Boots likes to tell it (oh yes, he does tell really good cat stories!), the front door opened and a nice lady came out. She saw him and said "Oh, you poor kitty..." Boots knew right away, that his life would change.</p>
<p style="font-size:large;">&emsp;The lady took him in the garage, fed him, and brought him a big, soft cat bed. He was warm, and his belly was finally full. Boots fell asleep purring loud to the nice lady sat petting him, saying to himself, "I don't care what you think &mdash; this is cat paradise!" From then on, every day was the perfect day!</p>
<p style="font-size:large;">&emsp;You know by now that the "But..." is coming. But one day Boots noticed lots of people in the yard. The yard was filled with things from the house. It didn't make any sense to him why the lady would want to give away her clothing and furniture. He heard her having a long conversation with another lady, but could not hear what was said. He had the surprise of his life when his mistress grabbed him. put him in a carrier, and handed him over to the lady on the phone. Just like that. How he cried! How he fought and begged to be released! Boots did not eat for days and refused to look at anyone. He learned that day that life can change in a heartbeat, both in good but also in bad ways. Luckily, this was a good change.</p>
<p style="font-size:large;">&emsp;The lady who took him was one of our volunteers. Boots's mistress was moving to a different state and could not take him along. It took a while for us to explain everything to Boots but he finally understood. I told you that he's an optimist! This fantastic, sweet, gorgeous, hunk of a boy &mdash; grey with white booties &mdash; is looking for his <em>truly</em> forever home. He is perfect; cuddly and playful, a (big) kitten at heart, he loves kisses and adores to be near you. All he wants is love. Are you the one he's been looking for? Are you the one to give him the home he has been dreaming of, where he feels safe and loved, and where no one moves to another state without him? We hope you are!</p>
<p style="font-size:large;">&emsp;The story could have ended here, but Boots is too special so we had to share more with you. Boots has a very developed vocabulary because he loves to read. Mainly about cats! But also about adventures. Please read to him every evening! And after so much effort, with all those letters, he is sure to take a nap in a cozy kitty bed which we hope you will get for him. Sometimes there may not be enough room for all of sweet Boots, and his paws will hang out. But that's okay!</p>
