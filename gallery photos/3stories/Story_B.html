<p style="font-size:large;">Marco is a baby! He came to us at 8 months old and loved to be held like a baby and sang to. He is a funny, sweet baby looking for love and protection. He loves to fall asleep in your arms, put his paw on your hand, and simply share the beauty of life with you. Marco has a unique look, with a domino black and white pattern on his sweet face. Not only is he astounding-looking, but is also extremely intelligent. Oh, and he loves to chat and share his thoughts with you!</p>

<p style="font-size:large;">Marco came from a very bad home. Actually, no, the home is great&mdash; there is a nice lady who takes in all the csts that other people throw out...then she calls us! There’s lots of people out there who abandon cats for no reason other than getting bored of them; ignoring that they have feelings and get scared, or worse, get desperate, that they are in pain and suffer. The fact that they are practically signing a death sentence for an innocent animal is of no concern to them. This was Marco’s case, and probably millions of cats like him. The wonderful thing is that Marco does not know about all these things. He just enjoys life: purrs, plays, eats, runs…doing exactly what every happy, healthy kitten in the world does. Because now, he is safe.</p>

<p style="font-size:large;">Marco likes to participate in every household activity, even washing dishes (with his tongue). He adores people. He adores cats. He adores holidays with the family. He adores falling asleep in your lap while you’re watching TV. Marco wants nothing more than a loving family, and if possible, his best friend&mdash;Benny!</p>
