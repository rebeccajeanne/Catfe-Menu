<p style="font-size:large;">&emsp;The call came on Sunday evening around 9:45 PM and triggered a series of improbable but fortunate events. First of all, let's call her Alice... Alice was never checking her phone on Sundays while preparing for another long week at work. Sandra, at the other end of the call was telling her in a frantic voice how a friend had reached out to her, asking if they could help these two cats whose owner had passed away 2 months ago. "The daughter is here cleaning up the apartment. She can't take them ('Why oh why?' Thought Alice without saying a word). She had tried several shelters but all turned them down."</p>
<p style="font-size:large;">&emsp;"Okay &mdash; we can probably help, but we need a bit of time. Let's talk tomorrow," replied Alice. "No, no, you don't understand," shouted Sandra, "We don't have time. They don't have time. The lady's daughter made an appointment for 8:30 AM tomorrow morning to put them down!" "Whaaaaaat? Where are they now?" "They are with a neighbor. She has them locked in a bathroom; one of the cats has been locked in a carrier for 3 days!" Alice didn't know where to start. How was she eating, or drinking...and so many other questions. "Okay. Let's think. Fast. We need a place they can stay. We need a foster... Let me call the only two available this month. Call your friend and tell her that we will take them. She should not touch them, not tomorrow at 8:30 AM, nor ever. Can you please do this?" Jenny called back at 11:30 PM confirming that she will take the 2 kitties who had lost one of their 9 lives that evening. It was a close call. Sandra rushed in the AM, picked them up, and dropped them off with Jenny. Ladies and gents, we are very proud and happy to introduce Gracie and Zoe, the two kitties who lived.</p>
<p style="font-size:large;">&emsp;Meet Zoe. She is the one who was locked in a carrier for 3 days; this episode plus losing her mom has scarred her. We are sure that time will heal her lack of confidence, but she wen't through a lot. It is easy to see how much she suffered just by looking at her. Zoe is very sweet, loves to be held, and enjoys very much being with her sister. She was marked to a much higher extent by the loss of her mom. The two sisters are looking for a home which would understand them, a house where they can relax, be a part of a vibrant family. A home where they can feel loved and safe again for the rest of their lives. Is your family the one they have been looking for?
