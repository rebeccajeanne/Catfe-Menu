<p style="font-size:large;">&emsp;Rose was abandoned at the pound. She does not know what she did wrong &mdash;but we do&mdash; Nothing! She sat in a cold cage and cried for two full weeks. When she realized that crying does not help, she changed her approach to life. She didn't find it in herself to purr but at least she started watching the people passing by. She would look intently at them but they all seemed to be too busy to look her way. But perseverence paid off! One day, this lady from Homeless Tails came by. Not only did Rose look at her, but she extended her paw through the cage's bars and touched the lady on her arm. She heared an "Oooooooh," then the lady went away. When she returned, the cage was opened and Rose was scooped up in the lady's arms. At that moment Rose started purring. Wouldn't you?</p>
<p style="font-size:large;">&emsp;Rose is a gentle sweetheart, but she is overwhelmed by her colleague-cats. Simply too many to her liking. Rose would do amazing in a family with no cats, or one or two of them...but not 12! She loves to watch TV sitting by your side, she is smart and curious, and loves to make sure that the repairman doesn't accidentally take any of her cans!</p>
<p style="font-size:large;">&emsp;She is playful and a great entertainer. She definitely, definitely prefers humans to kitties. She dreams and talks about her own house all the time. Would you help Rose fulfill her dream? She absolutely deserves it.</p>
