<p style="font-size:large;">Cagney and Lacey (ear-tip and all!) — the perfect pair and partners in purrs! These sweet, playful girls started their life struggling to survive within a feral colony in Newark, and when they were trapped for TNR (Trap, Neuter, and Release), they were just too loving to let go! Now they’re thriving indoors and soaking up every bit of affection. They are ready for their very first home, together. Mellow, affectionate, and full of heart, they’re ready to start their happily ever after with someone who will treasure them as much as they’ll treasure you.</p>
