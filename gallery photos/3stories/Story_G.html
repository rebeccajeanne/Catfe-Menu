<p style="font-size:large;">&emsp;The call came on Sunday evening around 9:45 PM and triggered a series of improbable but fortunate events. First of all, let's call her Alice... Alice was never checking her phone on Sundays while preparing for another long week at work. Sandra, at the other end of the call was telling her in a frantic voice how a friend had reached out to her, asking if they could help these two cats whose owner had passed away 2 months ago. "The daughter is here cleaning up the apartment. She can't take them ('Why oh why?' Thought Alice without saying a word). She had tried several shelters but all turned them down."</p>
<p style="font-size:large;">&emsp;"Okay &mdash; we can probably help, but we need a bit of time. Let's talk tomorrow," replied Alice. "No, no, you don't understand," shouted Sandra, "We don't have time. They don't have time. The lady's daughter made an appointment for 8:30 AM tomorrow morning to put them down!" "Whaaaaaat? Where are they now?" "They are with a neighbor. She has them locked in a bathroom; one of the cats has been locked in a carrier for 3 days!" Alice didn't know where to start. How was she eating, or drinking...and so many other questions. "Okay. Let's think. Fast. We need a place they can stay. We need a foster... Let me call the only two available this month. Call your friend and tell her that we will take them. She should not touch them, not tomorrow at 8:30 AM, nor ever. Can you please do this?" Jenny called back at 11:30 PM confirming that she will take the 2 kitties who had lost one of their 9 lives that evening. It was a close call. Sandra rushed in the AM, picked them up, and dropped them off with Jenny. Ladies and gents, we are very proud and happy to introduce Gracie and Zoe, the two kitties who lived.</p>
<p style="font-size:large;">&emsp;Gracie is super optimistic by nature. Everything somehow worked out for her. She wasn't scared or worried. She is a superb long hair Maine Coon mix, with an almost smiling face. When Gracie purrs, the entire neighborhood hears. She loves life, loves to cuddle and play, loves to lay in your arms. She never hurries, never runs like the wind; Gracie is the epitome of... Grace. She is the one with ideas, she is the one who invents games.</p>
<p style="font-size:large;">&emsp;Gracie is so special, so sweet and loving, she (along with her sister, Zoe) deserves a second chance. She wants only love and attention. In addition, she bears the responsibility of caring for her sister. Please find it in your heart to welcome these two kitties in your life. We guarantee so much happiness.</p>
