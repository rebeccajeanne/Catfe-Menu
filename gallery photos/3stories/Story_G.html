<p style="font-size:large;">Sweet, calm Dallas is waiting for his forever home! At the Catfe he keeps to himself— this gentle soul would much rather be the king of a quiet home or part of a smaller, peaceful pack. He’s playful too, when he doesn’t have to compete for toys.</p>
<p style="font-size:large;">Dallas was surrendered to the Paterson pound, and one persons trash is another person’s treasure. He may have been tossed aside, but to us he’s pure gold. He is front-declawed (ouch), so we’re extra grateful he’s safe inside now. If your home needs calm energy and a beautiful, soothing presence, Dallas might be the gentleman you’ve been searching for.</p>
